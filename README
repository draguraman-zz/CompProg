This is a collection of my solutions for some of the ProjectEuler, USACO and 
UVa problems.
Though most of the files out there are not commented, hope it helps someone 
out there. 
*.c files should be compiled in C++ since C is "more restrictive". 
The only drawback is that C++ has stricter type checking which is sometimes
annoying but could be helpful in catching errors.
